## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure API Keys
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
# Metals.dev API Configuration
# No quotes needed around the API key
METALS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Open Exchange Rates API Configuration
OPENEXCHANGERATES_APP_ID=your_app_id_here

# News API Configuration
NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key_here

# Optional: API Configuration
METALS_BASE_URL=https://api.metals.dev/v1
OPENEXCHANGERATES_BASE_URL=https://openexchangerates.org/api
```

### 3. Get API Keys
**For Metals Data:**
1. Visit [metals.dev](https://metals.dev)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Get your API key
4. Add it to the `.env` file

**For Forex Data:**
1. Visit [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Get your App ID
4. Add it to the `.env` file

**For News Data:**
1. Visit [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Get your API key
4. Add it to the `.env` file

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Regenerating the Forex Forecast Artefacts

The forecasting utilities in `forex_forecast.py` load a persisted LSTM model
and scaler from `models/forex_lstm.keras` and `models/forex_scaler.pkl`. These
files are ignored by Git so every contributor should recreate them locally
before running features that rely on forex predictions.

1. Install the project dependencies (TensorFlow and scikit-learn are listed in
   `requirements.txt`):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the deterministic training script. The example below rebuilds the
   default EUR‚ÜíUSD model and scaler:

   ```bash
   python scripts/train_forex_model.py --currency USD
   ```

   You can adjust the lookback window, number of epochs, or target currency via
   the CLI flags (see `python scripts/train_forex_model.py --help`).

3. The regenerated artefacts are written to the `models/` directory. Subsequent
   calls to `forecast_next_rate()` in `forex_forecast.py` will load them
   automatically. Passing `auto_train=True` will trigger the same export
   routine if the files are missing.
